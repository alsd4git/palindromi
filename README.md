# **Palindromi - imordnilaP**

I made this repo to host my own version (with proper history) of a simple old-style site that i really enjoyed with friends and colleagues, recently the site db apparently went down, so the site is unusable now, i recovered most of it thanks to the internet wayback machine (thanks [http://web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org/) !)
i'm planning to make my own version one day, but for now i will just provide a txt with list of palindrome that was hosted on that site
edit: now this repo is on github pages! you can see my version of the original site here: [Palindromi](https://alsd4git.github.io/palindromi/)
